# states

State machines in javascript

* redux
* vanilla node
* ampersand state

## install

Clone this repo.


## run

To make things more difficult we're using es6, so you need to run files like `babel-node example.js`.


## redux

A single store (state container) with a single function that handles state mutations.

To handle complex state, split up the event handler function so that operations deal with smaller subsections of the state tree.
